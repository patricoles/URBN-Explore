#Git
All work must be done on a separate branch. Submit Pull Request for each objective. All branches must be reviewed before merging into master.

#Naming
Keep everything organized. Create folders and name files accordingly. Example "FileRelationship-Subclass.swift". Lets keep every word capitalized.
